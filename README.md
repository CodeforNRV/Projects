# Projects
A list of our projects and new project ideas. Have an idea for a project? Post and discuss on the [issues](https://github.com/CodeforNRV/Projects/issues) page!


This space is an open forum for people to propose project ideas, be it something cool they really want to build or some problem in the New River Valley or Virginia you think can be fixed.


This repository is also tied to a [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/CodeforNRV/Projects) board for easy viewing and filtering, so be sure to check that out!
